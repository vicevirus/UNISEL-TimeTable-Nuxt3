# UNISEL TimeTable Vue App (Unofficial)

This Nuxt.js app displays the timetable for the Universiti Selangor (UNISEL) across its campuses. It allows users to select a campus and a subject, and displays the timetable for the selected subject in a table format. PWA is also included thanks to kevinmarrec/nuxt-pwa-module.

This project is linked to the timetable API created on my previous Fast API project. Previous project is in vanilla Vue. Intends to use Nuxt SSR for better SEO.
